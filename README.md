## Tools used

### Figma For UI/UX Design  
I used the design of designer `Ibrahim Memon` from Figma, which you can see here : [Click here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1182197835889504018)

### HTML 
I used HTML to build the basics of the site along with the use of `SVG` graphics.
### CSS 
I used CSS to add a beautiful shape to the site, and I was facing a simple problem, which was that I could not find a specific icon called <br>
`icon vector`, which is the modern icon menu, so I solved this problem by `creating it manually`. <br>
I also added responsiveness to the site so that the site would be `responsive` to all screens.
### JavaScript
I added JavaScript to achieve interactivity on the site, taking into account `ECMAScript` standards.
